    """
    This command starts a DistKV server. It defaults to connecting to the local Serf
    agent.

    All DistKV servers must have a unique name. Its uniqueness cannot be
    verified reliably.

    One server in your network needs either an initial datum, or a copy of
    a previously-saved DistKV state. Otherwise, no client connections will
    be accepted until synchronization with the other servers in your DistKV
    network is complete.

    This command requires a unique NAME argument. The name identifies this
    server on the network. Never start two servers with the same name!

    You can force the server to fetch its data from a specific node, in
    case some data are corrupted. (This should never be necessary.)

    A server will refuse to start up as long as it knows about missing
    entries. Use the 'force' flag to disable that. You should disable
    any clients which use this server until the situation is resolved!

    An auhthoritative server doesn't have missing data in its storage by
    definition. This flag is used in the 'run' script when loading from a
    file.
