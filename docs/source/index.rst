===============================================
DistKV: A distributed no-master key-value store
===============================================

Rationale
=========

Any kind of distributed storage is subject to the CAP theorem (also called
"Brewer's theorem"): you can't get all of (global) Consistency,
Availability, and Partition tolerance. The problem is that you do want all
three of these.

One way around this problem is to recognize that on most KV storage
systems, any given record is rarely (if ever) changed by more than one
entity at the same time. Thus, a simple gossip protocol is sufficient
for distributing data.

DistKV is intended to be used in a mostly-RAM architecture. There is no
disk-based storage backend; snapshots and event logs are used to restore a
system, if necessary.

See `Protocol Overview <overview.html>` for details about DistKV's
choices.

API
===

DistKV offers an efficient interface to access and change data.


Status
======

DistKV is in production use as the backbone of the author's home and office
automation setup.

Note that as of DistKV 0.30, multi-word paths were replaced with dotted
strings. Some pieces of documentation might still reflect the old style.
