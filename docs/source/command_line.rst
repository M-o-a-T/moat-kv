==================
The DistKV command
==================

DistKV uses one command line tool, appropriately named ``distkv``. It
provides various sub- and sub-sub-commands to run and control your server.

Each command and sub-command accepts a distinct set of options which must
be used directly after the (sub)command affected by them.

distkv
======

.. program:: distkv

The main entry point for all commands.

Use the option ``--help`` to show that (sub)command's detailed information.

Options used only for testing are not shown in the commands' help text.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Increase debugging verbosity. Broadly speaking, the default is
   ``ERROR``; this option selects ``WARNING``, ``INFO`` or ``DEBUG``
   depending on how often you use it.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Decrease debugging verbosity: the opposite of :option:`distkv -v`,
   reducing the verbosity to ``FATAL``.

.. option:: -l, --log <source=LEVEL>

   You can selectively adjust debugging verbosity if you need to print, or
   ignore, some types of messages. Example: ``distkv -vvv --log
   asyncactor=ERROR server NAME`` would suppress most chattiness of the
   Actor that's responsible for inter-server synchronization.

.. option:: -D, --debug

   Some DistKV methods, in particular cryptographic operations, are not
   noted for their speed. This option reduces the bit count of these
   options in order to speed them up significantly.

   It also reduces their security unacceptably. Thus, this option should
   only used while debugging.

.. option:: -c, --cfg <FILE>

   Specify a YAML configuration file.

   Data in this file override the corresponding entries in the
   ``distkv.defaults.CFG`` directory.

   The config will be loaded from the first of these files, assuming it's
   readable:

   * ~/config/distkv.cfg
   * ~/.config/distkv.cfg
   * ~/.distkv.cfg
   * /etc/distkv/distkv.cfg
   * /etc/distkv.cfg

   If you don't want to read any config file, use ``/dev/null``.

.. option:: -C, --conf <location=value>
   
   Set a specific configuration value.
   This option takes precedence over :option:`distkv -c`.


.. program:: distkv server

Run the DistKV server.

A DistKV server holds all data and syncs with all other DistKV servers.
You can't run :program:`distkv client` unless you have at least one running
server.

There is no separate option to set the address for clients to connect to;
use ``server.bind_default.port=57589`` (or your own port number) to change
it from the default of ``27589``, or use a configuration file.

.. option:: -l, --load <file>

   Pre-load the saved data from this file into the server before starting it.

   **Do not use this option with an out-of-date savefile.**

.. option:: -s, --save <file>

   Log all changes to this file. This includes the initial data.

   This option is only used for testing. Use ``distkv client log dest`` in
   production use.

.. option:: -i, --incremental

   Don't write the complete state to the save file.

   This option is of limited usefulness and only used for testing.
   Use ``distkv client log dest -i`` in production.

A network of servers needs to contain some data before it becomes
operational. When starting the first server, you can use an initial 

.. option:: -I, --init <value>

   Initialize the server by storing this value in the root entry.

   This option is only used for testing. Create initial content with
   ``distkv dump init`` for production use.

.. option:: -e, --eval

   Evaluate the initial value, as a standard Python expression.

   This option is only used for testing.

You can also use :program:`distkv client data set` to update this value
later.

.. option:: name

Each DistKV server requires a unique name. If you recycle a name, the old
server using it will die (unless your network is segmented – in that case,
one or both will terminate some random time after the networks are
reconnecting, and you'll get inconsistent data). So don't do that.


.. program:: distkv client

This subcommand collects all sub-subcommand which talk to a DistKV server.

.. option:: -h, --host <address>

   The address to connect to. Defaults to ``localhost``.

   This setting is also available as the ``connect.host`` configuration
   setting.

.. option:: -p, --port <port>

   The port to connect to. Defaults to 27586.

   This setting is also available as the ``connect.port`` configuration
   setting.

.. option:: -a, --auth <params>

   Parameters for authorizing this client. Use ``=file`` to load the data
   from a file, or ``method data=value…`` to provide them inline.

   The default is ``_anon``, i.e. no authorization.

.. option:: -m, --metadata

   The results of many commands will include the metadata associated with the
   entry or entries in question. This allows you to safely modify a value.


.. program:: distkv client data

Basic data access.

.. option:: path

   Access the entry at this location.


.. program:: distkv client data get

Read a DistKV value.

If you read a sub-tree recursively, be aware that the whole subtree may
be read before anything is printed. Use the ``monitor --state`` subcommand
for incremental output.

.. option:: -r, --recursive

   Print all entries below this entry.

.. option:: -d, --as-dict <text>

   When you use this option, the data is printed as a dictionary.
   The argument of this option controls which key is used for the actual
   value; this string should not occur as a path element.

   The customary value to use is a single underscore.

   Using this option in conjunction with ``--recursive`` requires keeping
   the whole data set in memory before starting to print anything. This may
   take a long time or eat a lot of memory.

   When this option is not used, the result is emitted as a list. Each item
   consists of a dictionary with a single entry; the key is the item's
   path. Some YAML parsers might not like that.

.. option:: -m, --mindepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, start at this depth off the given path.

   The default is zero, i.e. include the entry itself.

.. option:: -M, --maxdepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, stop at this depth (inclusive).

   The default is to print the whole tree. Use ``1`` to print the entry itself
   (assuming that it has a value and you didn't use ``--mindepth=1``)
   and its immediate children.


.. program:: distkv client data list

List DistKV values.

This command is basically like ``distkv client data ‹path› get``, except that
``--recursive`` and ``empty`` are always set. ``mindepth`` and ``maxdepth``
default to 1.

.. option:: -r, --recursive

   Print all entries below this entry.

.. option:: -d, --as-dict <text>

   When you use this option, the data is printed as a dictionary.
   The argument of this option controls which key is used for the actual
   value; this string should not occur as a path element.

   The customary value to use is a single underscore.

   Using this option in conjunction with ``--recursive`` requires keeping
   the whole data set in memory before starting to print anything. This may
   take a long time or eat a lot of memory.

.. option:: -m, --mindepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, start at this depth off the given path.

   The default is zero, i.e. include the entry itself.

.. option:: -M, --maxdepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, stop at this depth (inclusive).

   The default is to print the whole tree. Use ``1`` to print the entry itself
   (assuming that it has a value and you didn't use ``--mindepth=1``)
   and its immediate children.


.. program:: distkv client data set

Store a value at some DistKV position.

If you update a value, you should use :option:`--last` (preferred) or
:option:`--prev` (if you must), to ensure that no other change collides
with yours.

When adding a new entry, use :option:`--new` to ensure that you don't
accidentally overwrite something.

.. option:: -v, --value <value>

   The value to store. This option is mandatory.

.. option:: -e, --eval

   Treat the ``value`` as a Python expression, to store anything that's not a
   string.

.. option:: -l, --last <node> <count>

   The chain link which last modified this entry.

.. option:: -n, --new

   Use this option instead of ``--last`` or ``prev`` if the entry is new, or
   has been deleted.

.. option:: -p, --prev <value>

   The value which this entry needs to have in order to be affected.

   Try not to use this option; ``--last`` is much better.

   This value is also affected by ``--eval``.


.. program:: distkv client data delete

Delete the value at some DistKV position.

If you delete a value, you should use :option:`--last` (preferred) or
:option:`--prev` (if you must), to ensure that no other change collides
with your deletion.

Recursive changes only check the entry you mention on the command line.

.. option:: -l, --last <node> <count>

   The chain link which last modified this entry.

.. option:: -e, --eval

   Treat the ``value`` as a Python expression, to store anything that's not a
   string.

.. option:: -p, --prev <value>

   The value which this entry needs to have in order to be affected.

   Try not to use this option; ``--last`` is much better.

   This value is also affected by ``--eval``.


.. program:: distkv client data monitor

Monitor changes to the state of an entry, or rather its subtree.

.. option:: -s, --state

   Before emitting changes, emit the current state of this subtree.

   A flag entry will be printed when this step is completed.

.. option:: -o, --only

   Only emit the value. This mode is ideal for monitoring an entry with a
   script or similar.

   This mode will only watch a single entry, not the whole tree. The command
   will exit silently if the value is deleted or, when ``--state`` is used,
   doesn't exist in the first place.

.. note::

   The current state may already include updates, due to DistKV's
   asynchonous nature. You should simply replace existing values.

.. option:: -m, --msgpack

   Write the output as ``MsgPack`` data. XXX TODO

   The default is to use YAML.


.. program:: distkv client data update

Stream a list of changes from standard input to DistKV. Paths in the data
set are interpreted relative to the path given.

.. option:: -m, --msgpack

   Interpret the input as ``MsgPack`` data. XXX TODO

   The default is to use YAML. XXX TODO


.. program:: distkv client control

Control your server.  XXX TODO


.. program:: distkv client log


Control logging of changes on the server.


.. program:: distkv client log dest

Set the file to log to. The old file is closed as soon as the new file is
ready (i.e. the current state is saved).

.. option:: -i, --incremental

   The save file will only contain changes, but not the current state.

.. option:: path

   The file to write to. Note that this file is on the server.


.. program:: distkv client log save

Save the current state of the server to this file.

.. option:: path

   The file to write to. Note that this file is on the server.


.. program:: distkv client log stop

Stop logging.


.. program:: distkv client auth

Set up and change client authorization.

If you have never setup authorization, this sub-subcommands' ``--help``
options may not work. Use ``-m root`` as a workaround.  XXX TODO

.. option:: -m, --method <name>

   Affect the named method.

   DistKV supports multiple authorization methods. The default is the one
   that has been changed to with ``distkv client auth init``.
   
   If you want to do anything with authorization, you'll need to use this
   flag to set up the initial users.

   See `Auth`.


.. program:: distkv client auth init

Set up this method.

.. option:: -s, --switch

   Actually swtich to using this method. This is the default for initial
   set-up.


.. program:: distkv client auth list

List configured auth methods.

XXX TODO


.. program:: distkv client auth user

Manage DistKV users.

Each authorization method has its own schema for validating users.


.. program:: distkv client auth user add <key>=<value>…

Add a new user.

Example: ``distkv client -a root auth -m password user add name=foo password=barbaz``

The identifier which you'd use to subsequently refer to that user is
printed when this command completes.

.. option:: <key>=<value>

   Set an auth-specific parameter. If you write ``password?`` instead of
   ``password=SomeSecret``, you tell DistKV to read the actual data from the
   terminal (without echo) so that it won't show up in your history.


.. program:: distkv client auth user mod <ident> <key>=<value>…

Modify a user.

.. option:: <ident>

   The identifier DistKV has assigned to the user.

.. option:: <key>=<value>
   Set an auth-specific parameter.


.. program:: distkv client auth user param <ident> <type> <key>

Modify a user's setting.

.. option:: <ident>

   The identifier DistKV has assigned to the user.

.. option:: <type>

   The type of setting to modify. The server interprets "acl" and "conv".

.. option:: <key>

   The type-dependent setting to use as stored in DistKV. For ACLs the
   relevant record is added with ``distkv client acl set <key> …``, for data
   conversion ``distkv client codec convert <key> …``.


.. program:: distkv client auth user auth

Check that authorizing a user works.

XXX TODO seems broken

.. option:: options…

   Whichever auth options you'd normally use in ``distkv client -a TYPE …``.


.. program:: distkv client auth user get

Dump data of a user.

.. option:: -c, --chain <int>

The chain length to return, for subsequent modification.

.. option:: ident

   The user identifier, as reported by ``add``.


.. program:: distkv client auth user list

List users.

XXX TODO add verbosity


.. program:: distkv client type

Set up DistKV's type control: verify the data that clients write.

See :doc:`translator` for details.


.. program:: distkv client type get

Retrieve a type entry.

.. option:: -y, --yaml

   Emit the schema as YAML data. Default: JSON.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Save the script to this file. Default: include in the output.

.. option:: -S, --schema <filename>

   Save the schema to this file. Default: include in the output.

.. option:: name…

   The type data to retrieve.


.. program:: distkv client type set

Add or modify a type entry.

For setting up a type, you need at least two good and one bad test value.
(If there's only one possible good value, you don't need the entry; if
there's no bad value you don't need the type check.)

Type checks accumulate: Both 'good' and 'bad' test values for "int
percent" must be accepted by "int".

Tests can use Python code, a JSON schema, or both. In the latter case the
schema is tested first.

To modify a record, use ``distkv client type get <path>… > <tempfile>``, edit
the tempfile, then restore with ``distkv client type set -d <tempfile> <path>…``.

.. option:: -y, --yaml

   Read the schema as YAML. Default: JSON.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Load the script from this file. Default: no script.

.. option:: -S, --schema <filename>

   Load the schema from this file. Default: no schema.

.. option:: -g <value>

   A known-good value to test the codec. It will be Python-evaluated.

.. option:: -b <value>

   A known-bad value to test the codec. It will be Python-evaluated.

.. option:: -a, --all

   Load the complete record from the ``script`` file.

.. option:: name…

   The type data to set.


.. program:: distkv client type match

Read, set or delete type matches, i.e. which part of your DistKV tree is
constricted by which type.

.. option:: -t, type <name>

   The type name to use. Use multiple `--type`` options to access subtypes.
   Skip this option to display which type corresponds to the given path.

.. option:: -d, --delete

   Delete the match record instead of printing it.

.. option:: path…

   The DistKV entry to affect. Path elements '+' and '#' match exactly-one and
   one-or-more subpaths. The most specific path wins.


.. program:: distkv client codec

Set up codecs: manipulate the data that clients see, sort of like a
database view.

Codecs consist of code that encodes, i.e. converts to the user's view, and
decodes, i.e. converts to the server's storage.

Codecs cannot translate path names, or access other entries. The decoder may
modify an existing entry (or rather, use the currently-stored version when
assembling an entry's new value).

Unlike types, the codec hierarchy is strictly for convenience.


.. program:: distkv client codec get

Retrieve information about a codec, including its scripts.

.. option:: -e, --encode <file>

   The file which the encoder's Python code is written to.

   If this option is not used, the code is part of the script's output.

.. option:: -d, --decode <file>

   The file which the decoder's Python code is written to.

   If this option is not used, the code is part of the script's output.

.. option:: -s, --script <file>

   The YAML file to which to write any other data.

   This file will also contain the scripts, if not stored otherwise.

.. option:: <name>

   The name of the codec group from which this codec should be retrieved.

.. option:: <path>

   The DistKV entry that would be affected. Path elements '+' and '#' match
   exactly-one and one-or-more subpaths. The most specific path wins.
   

.. program:: distkv client codec set

Add or modify a codec.

To modify a codec, use ``distkv client codec get <path>… > <tempfile>``, edit the
tempfile, then restore with ``distkv client codec set -d <tempfile> <path>…``.

.. option:: -e, --encode <file>

   The file which contains the encoder's Python code.

.. option:: -d, --decode <file>

   The file which contains the decoder's Python code.

.. option:: -i, --in <source> <dest>

   A pair of test values for the decoding branch of the codec.
   Both are ``eval``-uated.

.. option:: -o, --out <source> <dest>

   A pair of test values for the encoding branch of the codec.
   Both are ``eval``-uated.

.. option:: -D, --data <file>

   The YAML file which contains any other data.
   
   Required: two arrays "in" and "out" containing tuples with before/after
   values for the decoder and encoder, respectively.

   You may store the scripts in this file, using "encode" and "decode" keys.

.. option:: <name>

   The name of the codec group to which this codec should be saved or
   modified.

.. option:: <path>

   The DistKV entry to affect. Path elements '+' and '#' match exactly-one and
   one-or-more subpaths. The most specific path wins.


.. program:: distkv client codec convert

Read, set or delete codec matches, i.e. which part of your DistKV tree is
managed by which codec. To this effect, matches are tagged by a group name.

Which codec group to apply to a given user is stored in that user's
auxiliary data as ``conv=NAME``. If no such entry is present, that user's
data are not converted.

.. option:: -c, --codec

   The codec to use on the given path. Use this option multiple times if
   the codec has a multi-level name.

.. option:: <name>

   The name of the codec group to which this codec should be saved or
   modified.

.. option:: <path>

   The DistKV entry to affect. Path elements '+' and '#' match exactly-one and
   one-or-more subpaths. The most specific path wins.


.. program:: distkv client acl

Manipulate access control lists stored in DistKV.


.. program:: distkv client acl list

Generate a list of known ACLs.


.. program:: distkv client acl get

Retrieve the flags at a specific ACL path.

If the path does not contain any flags, print ``-``.

.. option:: <acl>

   The ACL to modify. Mandatory.

.. option:: <path>

   The ACL path from which to retrieve the flags.


.. program:: distkv client acl set

Set the flags at a specific ACL path.

.. option:: -a, --acl <MODES>

   The flag values to set. Start with ``+`` to add, ``-`` to remove modes.
   Use an empty argument (``''``) to remove all rights. A lone ``-``
   removes the entry.

.. option:: <acl>

   The ACL to modify. Mandatory.

.. option:: <path>

   The ACL path to add or modify.


.. program:: distkv client acl test

Check whether an ACL allows access.

.. option:: -m, --mode <mode>

   Check this mode (single letter). The default is "x".

.. option:: -a, --acl <acl>

   In addition to the user's current ACL, also check the flag on the named ACL.

   There is no indication which of the two failed. This is intentional.

.. option:: <path>

   The path to check.


.. program:: distkv client acl dump

Dump an ACL's content.

.. option:: -d, --as-dict TEXT

   Print as dictionary. ``TEXT`` is the key used for the ACL data.

   Default: Emit a list.

   Using this flag requires storing the whole ACL in memory, which is
   usually not a problem (unlike for data).

.. option:: <name>

   The name of the ACL to dump. Mandatory.

.. option:: <path>

   The path to start dumping at. Default: the root.


.. program:: distkv client code

Manipulate code stored in DistKV.


.. program:: distkv client code list

List code snippets stored in DistKV.

.. option:: -d, --as-dict <text>

   When you use this option, the data is printed as a dictionary.
   The argument of this option controls which key is used for the actual
   value; this string should not occur as a path element.

   The customary value to use is a single underscore.

   Using this option in conjunction with ``--recursive`` requires keeping
   the whole data set in memory before starting to print anything. This may
   take a long time or eat a lot of memory.

.. option:: -s, --short

   Print one-line entries.

   Incompatible with ``-f`` and ``-d``.

.. option:: -f, --full

   Print the actual code.

   Otherwise, code is not printed and a "number of lines" ``info`` entry is
   generated (if missing).

.. option:: -m, --mindepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, start at this depth off the given path.

   The default is zero, i.e. include the entry itself.

.. option:: -M, --maxdepth <integer>

   When printing recursively, stop at this depth (inclusive).

   The default is to print the whole tree. Use ``1`` to print the entry itself
   (assuming that it has a value and you didn't use ``--mindepth=1``)
   and its immediate children.

.. option:: path…

   List the code below this location.


.. program:: distkv client code get

Retrieve Python code stored in the server.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Save the code to <filename> instead of including it in the output.

.. option:: <path> …

   Path to the code in question.


.. program:: distkv client code set

Store or replace Python code stored in the server.

This code will not run in the server; the purpose of these calls is to
upload code for use by client runners.

To modify some code, use ``distkv client code get <path>… > <tempfile>``, edit
the tempfile, then restore with ``distkv client code set -d <tempfile> <path>…``.

.. option:: -d, --data <filename>

   Load the metadata from this file.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Load the code from this file.

.. option:: -a, --async

   The code will run asynchronously, i.e. it may use ``async`` and ``await`` statements.

   You should only use the ``anyio`` module for sleeping, locking etc..

.. option:: -t, --thread

   The code will run in a worker thread.

   This option is incompatible with ``--async``.

.. option:: name…

   The path to the code to write.

TODO: Old versions of the code continue to run; DistKV does not yet restart users.


.. program:: distkv client code module

Manipulate modules stored in DistKV.

Modules are replaced immediately, but code using them is **not**
auto-restarted.

This code is experimental and frankly just plain wrong: Module loading is
not deferred until "import" time. This code needs sever refactoring. For now, please store modules
in the file system.


.. program:: distkv client code module get

Retrieve Python module stored in the server.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Save the code to <filename> instead of including it in the output

.. option:: <path> …

   Path to the code in question.


.. program:: distkv client code module set

Store or replace Python code stored in the server.

This code will not run in the server; the purpose of these calls is to
upload code for use by client-side runners.

To modify a module, use ``distkv client code module get <path>… > <tempfile>``, edit
the tempfile, then restore with ``distkv client code module set -d <tempfile> <path>…``.

.. option:: -d, --data <filename>

   Load the metadata from this file.

.. option:: -s, --script <filename>

   Load the module's code from this file.

.. option:: name…

   The path to the code to set, below ``.distkv code proc`` or whatever
   else is configured under ``codes``.

TODO: Old versions of the code continue to run; DistKV does not yet restart users.



.. program:: distkv client job

Subcommand for controlling and executing code stored in DistKV.

.. option:: -n, --node <node>

   The node where the code in question will run.

   Code marked with this option will run on exactly this node. The default
   is the local node name.

.. option:: -g, --group <group>

   The group which the code in question shall run on.

   The default group is "all".


.. program:: distkv client job run

This is the actual runner, i.e. the program that runs stored tasks.

This program does not terminate.


.. program:: distkv client job info

List available groups (or nodes, if ``-g -`` is used).


.. program:: distkv client job list

List available run entries.

The output is YAML-formatted unless ``-t`` is used.

.. option:: -d, --as-dict <text>

   When you use this option, the data is printed as a dictionary.
   Otherwise it's a list of dicts with the entries' path as single key.

.. option:: -s, --state

   Add the current state.

.. option:: -S, --state-only

   Only print the current state.

.. option:: -t, --table

   Print a table with one line per job.

.. option:: <prefix>

   Limit listing to this prefix.


.. program:: distkv client run get

Read a runner entry.


.. program:: distkv client run set

Create or change a runner entry.

.. option:: -c, --code <code>

   Path to the code that this entry should execute. This value is either
   split by spaces or, if ``--eval`` is used, interpreted as a Python
   expression.

.. option:: -t, --time <when>

   Time at which the runner should fire next. Seconds in the future.

.. option:: -r, --repeat <seconds>

   Time after a successful execution when the runner should fire again.

.. option:: -d, --delay <seconds>

   Time after an unsuccessful execution when the runner should fire again.

.. option:: -k, --ok <seconds>

   If a task runs for longer than this many seconds, it's considered OK and
   any error associated with it is cleared.

   Errors are also cleared when a task exits, which won't work for tasks
   that typically do not.

.. option:: -b, --backoff

   Back-off exponent. The effective delay is ``delay * backoff ^ n_failures``.

   To retry a failure immediately, simply use ``--time now``.


.. program:: distkv client internal

Subcommand for viewing and modifying the internal state of a DistKV server.


.. program:: distkv client internal dump

This command emits DistKV's internal state.

The output is comparable to ``distkv client data dump -rd_``, but for internal
data.

.. option:: <path> …

   Path prefix for DistKV's internal data structure.


.. program:: distkv client internal state

This command queries the internal state of a DistKV server.

All lists of ``tick`` values are sorted and consist of either single
entries, or ``[begin,end)`` tuples, i.e. the starting value is part of the
range but the end is not.

.. option:: -y, --yaml

   Print the result of this operation as YAML data.

.. option:: -n, --nodes

   Add a list of known nodes and their current ``tick`` value.

.. option:: -d, --deleted

   Add a list of per-node deleted ``tick`` values, i.e. those whose entries
   have been purged from the system.

.. option:: -p, --present

   Add a list of per-node ``tick`` values which can be retrieved via
   node+tick, i.e. for which a chain entry exists.

.. option:: -s, --superseded

   Add a list of per-node ``tick`` values which have been superseded by
   subsequent changes. This is returned as "known".

.. option:: -m, --missing

   Add a list of per-node missing ``tick`` values, i.e. those neither in
   the ``known`` list nor seen in any entries' chains.

.. option:: -r, --remote-missing

   Add a list of per-node missing ``tick`` values that have been requested
   from other servers.

See `Server protocol <server_protocol>` for details.


.. program:: distkv client internal mark

Mark ticks as known or deleted. This is used to clean up the ``missing``
range(s) when there's a consistency problem.

.. option:: -d, --deleted

   Add the nodes to the ``deleted`` list instead of the ``known`` list. The
   effect is that if they subsequently re-surcace they'll be ignored.

.. option:: -b, --broadcast

   Send the changes to the whole network, not just the node you're a client
   of. (The local node is still targeted first, to ensure that if your
   message should crash the server at least it'll only crash one.)

.. option:: <node>

   The node whose ticks shall be used.

.. option:: <item> …

   The tick values you want to clear. Taken from the current ``missing``
   list if not specified here; in this case, an empty ``node`` means to
   take the whole list, not just the ones for ``node``.


.. program:: distkv client internal deleter

Manage the list of nodes that collectively manage cleaning deleted entries from
the DistKV tree.

All of these nodes must be online for clean-up to work.

.. option:: -d, --delete

   Remove the mentioned nodes. Default is to add them.

.. option:: <node> …

   Nodes to add or delete. If none are given, list the current state, or (with
   ``--delete``) clear the list, disabling node deletion.

   If you want to shut deletion down temporarily, you can also add a
   nonexistent node to the list.


.. program:: distkv client error

Manage errors.


.. program:: distkv clent error dump

Show currently-logged errors.


.. program:: distkv clent error resolve

Mark an error as handled.

DistKV does this itself, usually, but not if the node which caused the
problem is deleted.


.. program:: distkv dump

Various low-level data handling commands.


.. program:: distkv dump cfg

Display the current configuration data.


.. program:: distkv dump file

Unpack a file and show its contents as YAML.

.. option:: <file>

   The name of the file to decode.


.. program:: distkv dump init

Create an initial data file.

.. option:: <node>

   The node name of the DistKV server that should load the initial file.

.. option:: <file>

   The file to write. Typically ``/var/lib/distkv/%Y-%m-%d/0.dkv``.


.. program:: distkv dump msg NAME…

Monitor all back-end messages. (I.e. not just those from DistKV.)
Decodes MsgPack messages. Display as YAML.

.. option:: NAME

   You may tell the monitor which stream to emit. By default it prints the
   main server's update stream for data. You may use

   * some random sequence of names, which is used as-is as the topic to
     monitor
   * ``+NAME``, to monitor this sub-stream instead
   * ``+`` to monitor all sub-streams (recursively; does not work with the
     Serf backend)


.. program:: distkv pdb

This subcommand imports the debugger and then continues to process arguments.

This can be used to drop into the debugger when an exception occurs, set
breakpoints, or whatever.

.. note::

   Stepping over async function calls may or may not work. If not, your
   best bet is to set a breakpoint on the next line.
